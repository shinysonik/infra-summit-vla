"""
Domain randomization for the dinner-table scene.

Owned by: feature/mujoco-scene
Consumed by: /eval (calls reset(seed) once per episode, before stepping)

Design contract with randomization.yaml:
  - `apply_at: episode_reset` -> reset() is the ONLY place any of this runs.
  - Every randomization is relative to NOMINAL values captured from the
    compiled model at construction time, never cumulative. reset(seed=3)
    twice in a row must produce the identical scene both times.
  - Every axis named in the brief (object placement, weight, friction, shape,
    lighting, background) is sampled from a config range, never hardcoded.

Placement / collision avoidance
--------------------------------
Each object is placed independently via rejection sampling: sample a
candidate (x, y, yaw) from its own range in randomization.yaml, check it
against every already-placed object this reset, accept if the gap is >=
min_gap_between_objects_m, else resample (up to `max_attempts`, then fall
back to the object's nominal pose -- per randomization.yaml `placement`).

This is pure 2D geometry, no MuJoCo collision calls -- see the PRD/README for
why (short version: mj_collision needs a forward-kinematics pass per
candidate, which is unnecessary cost and a chicken-and-egg problem when
you're trying to decide the pose that produces that forward pass in the
first place; closed-form circle/segment distance is exact for these shapes
and effectively free).

Two footprint types, matching what the objects actually are:
  - circle:  plate, cup, bottle -- round, footprint = center + radius.
  - capsule: cutlery -- 12cm-long, 6mm-radius. Modeled as an actual line
    segment, NOT a bounding circle of radius (half_length + radius) -- a
    circle that size would be wildly conservative for how thin these
    objects really are and would make four of them nearly impossible to
    place close together. Segment endpoints are derived from the object's
    (x, y, yaw): the capsule geom lies along local Z by default and is
    rotated -90deg about X in the MJCF to lie flat along world Y, so an
    additional yaw rotation about world Z (the same composition
    _apply_pose uses) points its axis along (-sin(yaw), cos(yaw)).

Placement order: objects are placed largest-effective-radius-first (plate,
then cup/bottle, then cutlery). This isn't required for correctness -- it
reduces how often later, smaller objects have to retry, since the biggest
gaps get claimed by the object least able to route around a conflict.

        through exactly that space, knocking over tall objects (the bottle).
        No amount of placement checking could fix that, because the pose
        being checked was one the robot never actually holds.

        Fix: settle the robot ALONE once (objects parked far off-scene so

        kp*(0 - qpos) = gravity torque, the arms begin at rest and stay at
        rest -- no droop, no sweep, and placement checks now validate
        against the pose the robot genuinely holds.

            frozen/pinned object's tiny zone gets crowded by other objects'

            de-prioritizes small-range objects and lets them get crowded
            out (verified: 1/100 real failure, bottle's tiny zone invaded).
            Pure range-first over-corrects and de-prioritizes the biggest
            objects instead, since their ranges are naturally the largest.

            identical at every yaw, so it has no orientation to rotate into
            whatever gap is left -- a capsule of similar size can angle
            itself to fit a gap a circle of the same effective radius
